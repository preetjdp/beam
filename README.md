# Beam

GPU-accelerated remote desktop for Linux, streaming to any browser via WebCodecs.

Fully open source, GPU-accelerated, sub-30ms latency. Built for developers who want to access their Linux workstation from any browser.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot or demo GIF here showing a desktop session with performance overlay (F9) -->
<!-- ![Beam desktop session](docs/screenshot.png) -->

## Features

- **GPU-accelerated encoding** — NVIDIA NVENC, AMD/Intel VA-API, or x264 software fallback
- **Low-latency streaming** — sub-30ms on LAN, WebCodecs hardware decode in the browser
- **Zero-install client** — works in Chrome 94+, Firefox 130+. No plugins, no app
- **Multi-user** — isolated virtual desktop sessions with PAM authentication
- **Audio streaming** — PulseAudio capture with Opus encoding
- **Clipboard sync** — copy/paste between local and remote desktops
- **Cursor shape passthrough** — remote cursor shape (text, pointer, resize, etc.) reflected locally
- **Dynamic resolution** — desktop resizes to match your browser viewport
- **Session persistence** — sessions survive server restarts (zero-downtime deploys)
- **Reconnect without re-login** — connection loss shows a reconnect overlay, no need to re-enter credentials
- **Mac keyboard support** — Cmd-to-Ctrl remapping, smooth trackpad scrolling
- **Auto keyboard layout** — detects your keyboard layout and syncs to the remote desktop
- **Performance overlay** — press F9 to see FPS, decode time, bitrate, and resolution
- **120fps default** — smooth desktop experience at high frame rates

## Install (Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13+)

### APT Repository (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frecar/beam/gh-pages/gpg/beam.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/beam.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/beam.gpg] https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frecar/beam/gh-pages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/beam.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install beam
```

Or use the one-liner:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frecar/beam/gh-pages/install | sudo bash
```

After installation, open `https://<your-server>:8444` and log in with any Linux user account.

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frecar/beam.git
cd beam
sudo make install
sudo systemctl enable --now beam
```

Requires Ubuntu 24.04+ or Debian 13+ (x86_64 or ARM64). Rust and Node.js are installed automatically if not present.

### GPU Support

Beam auto-detects your GPU and selects the best encoder:
- **NVIDIA** — requires drivers 535+ (`nvidia-smi` to check). Uses NVENC for lowest latency
- **AMD / Intel** — uses VA-API (`vainfo` to check)
- **No GPU** — falls back to x264 software encoding (higher CPU usage, still functional)

## Verify

```bash
beam-server --version
beam-doctor              # full diagnostic
beam-doctor --capture    # capture stack only — a scriptable post-deploy gate,
                         # exits non-zero if a session would black-screen
```

## Configuration

Edit `/etc/beam/beam.toml` (installed) or `config/beam.toml` (development):

```toml
[server]
bind = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8444
# web_root = "/usr/share/beam/web/dist"  # set automatically on install
# tls_cert = "/etc/beam/cert.pem"        # auto-generated if absent
# tls_key = "/etc/beam/key.pem"
# client_metrics_enabled = false         # opt-in anonymous connection-quality metrics

[observability]
# sentry_dsn = ""                        # empty/absent disables browser error reporting
# sentry_traces_sample_rate = 0.0        # 0.0 to 1.0
# sentry_environment = "production"

[video]
# Measured software/WAN starting profile; hardware/LAN deployments may use the
# 50 Mbps / 120 fps repository defaults after benchmarking their path.
bitrate = 15000     # kbps
min_bitrate = 4000
max_bitrate = 20000
framerate = 60
# encoder = "x264enc"    # auto: nvcudah264enc > nvh264enc > vah264enc > x264enc
# max_width = 3840
# max_height = 2160
# max_pixels = 8294400   # encoded physical-pixel budget
# max_dpr = 2.0
# hidpi_enabled = false  # first deploy in observe-only DPR mode
# h264_profile = "main" # auto|main|high; enhanced profiles are negotiated
# x264_preset = "veryfast"
# frame_header_version = 1 # v2 adds generation/sequence/dependency metadata
# treatment_id = "baseline"

[audio]
enabled = true
bitrate = 128       # kbps (Opus)

[session]
max_sessions = 8
# idle_timeout = 3600  # seconds (0 = disabled, default: 3600)
```

### Streaming experiments

Each login emits a versioned effective stream manifest and the session/F9 diagnostics show the negotiated codec/profile, encoder, control/media transport, resolution, DPR, FPS/bitrate targets, and treatment ID. Requested enhancements that are not active remain on the H.264 Main/WSS compatibility path with a reason.

Use `scripts/stream-benchmark.sh` for opt-in, cleanup-safe process/network collection and `scripts/stream-report.py` for median/tail/effect-size reports. The benchmark runner refuses OS `/tmp`, requires `BEAM_BENCH_ALLOW_NETEM=1` before changing a qdisc, and restores shaping on every exit path.

### TLS Certificate

Beam auto-generates a self-signed certificate on first run. Browsers will show a security warning — click through it or set up a trusted certificate:

**Option A: mkcert (recommended for LAN/dev)**
```bash
# Install mkcert (creates a local CA trusted by your browser)
sudo apt install libnss3-tools
curl -JLO "https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases/download/v1.4.4/mkcert-v1.4.4-linux-amd64"
sudo mv mkcert-v1.4.4-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mkcert && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mkcert
mkcert -install

# Generate cert for your hostname
mkcert -cert-file /etc/beam/cert.pem -key-file /etc/beam/key.pem "$(hostname)" "$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')"
sudo systemctl restart beam
```

**Option B: Let's Encrypt (internet-facing servers)**
```bash
sudo apt install certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d beam.example.com
# Update /etc/beam/beam.toml:
# tls_cert = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/beam.example.com/fullchain.pem"
# tls_key = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/beam.example.com/privkey.pem"
sudo systemctl restart beam
```

**Option C: Existing certificate** — set `tls_cert` and `tls_key` in `/etc/beam/beam.toml`.

## Production Deployment

### Network

The compatibility deployment needs only **port 8444/tcp** (HTTPS + WSS). H.264 Main over WSS remains available to every client. Experimental WebTransport profiles additionally require UDP on the same numeric HTTPS port; do not advertise HTTP/3 until that listener is configured and healthy.

- Beam binds to `0.0.0.0` by default — restrict with `bind = "10.0.0.1"` in `beam.toml` if needed

### Browser Requirements

- **Chrome / Edge**: 94+
- **Firefox**: 130+

Beam uses the WebCodecs API for hardware-accelerated video decoding in the browser.

### Reverse Proxy

Beam's IP-based rate limiting uses the direct TCP peer address. If running behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy), all clients share the proxy's IP. Configure `bind = "127.0.0.1"` and handle TLS termination at the proxy level.

## Troubleshooting

Run the diagnostic tool:
```bash
beam-doctor
```

### Server starts but browser shows blank page
- Check that the web client is built: `ls web/dist/index.html`
- For installed systems, verify `web_root` in `/etc/beam/beam.toml` points to the right directory
- Run `make doctor` to check encoder availability

### Black screen after login
- Run `beam-doctor --capture` — it checks just the capture stack (GStreamer, an
  H.264 encoder element, the Xorg dummy driver) and exits non-zero if a piece is
  missing, which is the usual cause of a black screen after an upgrade
- Check agent logs: `journalctl -u beam -f` and `/var/log/beam/agent-*.log`
- Press F9 to open the performance overlay and check if frames are arriving
- This usually means H.264 frames aren't reaching the browser — force a reconnect (refresh the page)

### High latency or choppy video
- Press F9 to open the performance overlay and check RTT, FPS, and encoder
- High RTT (>50ms on LAN) may indicate network congestion
- Low FPS with high CPU may mean software encoding — install GPU drivers for hardware acceleration
- Try reducing resolution or bitrate in `/etc/beam/beam.toml`

### Non-US keyboard layout
- Beam auto-detects your keyboard layout in Chrome/Edge using the Keyboard Layout Map API
- If auto-detection doesn't work (Firefox, Safari), use the layout selector in the status bar
- Your layout choice is saved automatically for future sessions

View logs:
```bash
journalctl -u beam -f
```

                                                           (Xorg + dummy driver)
                                                           + XFCE4 desktop
                                                           + PulseAudio
```

The server handles authentication and signaling. When a user logs in, it spawns a per-user agent process that creates an isolated virtual display, captures the screen via XCB shared memory, encodes with GStreamer (NVENC/VA-API/x264), and streams to the browser over a WebSocket connection. The browser decodes frames using the WebCodecs API with hardware acceleration.

## Security

**Reporting**: Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities. Use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/frecar/beam/security/advisories/new). We aim to acknowledge within 48 hours.

**Security model**: PAM authentication, per-user isolated virtual displays, all traffic over a single TLS WebSocket (no P2P), JWT session tokens (24h), rate limiting (5 failures/60s per username + 20/60s per /64 prefix). See `CLAUDE.md` Security Decisions for settled implementation choices.

This project has not undergone a formal security audit.
